This project consists of an agenda with the following functions:

1- Add note: in this option it will ask you the date in which some event of your preference will be carried out or that you are doing of the home, etc. Here we will be able to notice that at the moment of adding the date that is preferred the program will indicate us in that time of the year you are adding this note and more important so that the change of schedule in these times is considered, later it will send you a message also that the note was created and a file .txt will be created for you.

2- Verify note: this option gives us the function to verify that there is written in the note of some date that we have added, for this it is going to ask us the date of the note that we want to verify and it will throw us later that there is written in the note, if the note does not exist the program will mention that the note you wrote does not exist.

3- Modify a note: this option helps us to write in the note that was created, the program will indicate us to enter the date of the note that we want to modify, later it will ask us what we want to add as a note and it will indicate us that the note was added successfully, if the note does not exist the program will mention that the note you wrote does not exist.

4- Eliminate note: this option is useful to eliminate some note that has been added with the wrong date or some similar case, for this the program will ask you to write the date of the note that you want to eliminate later it will indicate you that the note was eliminated.

Steps to follow for the correct operation of the program:

1- First step: you are going to copy the code with the name of schedule.c, then copy the code of functions.h, once you have both of them you execute the code of schedule.c so that the program can start.

2- Second step: you will use the option "add note", follow the instructions that the program indicates together with the example in which you have to write the date in format of day, month and year finally you will press enter.

3- Third step: you will choose the option of "exit", this so that the changes in the notes that you have created and modified are saved and finish their process, later you will verify the folder in which you have the program to check that your .txt files are there with their name.

4- Four step: you will choose the option "modify a note", so you can add what you will do that day, either a birthday or even a list of things to do as mentioned above.

5- Five step: you will select the "exit" option again so that the changes when using the "modify a note" will be saved later and also check that when you open the file the note has been added correctly, then you can exit the program if you like.

Optional steps:

If you want to verify using the program after you have first performed the above steps, you will select the "verify note" option in which you will see what is written in the .txt file you have selected to verify.

And finally, emphasizing that the above steps are performed first, you can finally delete a note that you have added in error with the "delete note" option.

Report:

First I put forward my idea of what my project would be which was what I presented in class, my primary idea was to add name, day, month, year. start time and end time of the event, also that the program identifies what time it is being scheduled whether it is spring, summer, fall or winter.

I started with my code making the structure of this that I started with a switch and the presentation of the menu, my idea of the design changed due to the limited functions that I know.

The design finally changed to create files with the name that this is the date in the format of day, month and year, in the process of making my code I chose to play with run and exit the program to save the changes made in the files.

I created the options to verify, modify and delete files, which work in a way that you add the file with its name using the date, then exit the program and use the modify, then enter the program and use the modify to add the note that you like, exit the program again to save the modification and verify it in the file, the last functions are more optional which are verify and delete note.

Self-evaluation:

1- complexity: 1 (I feel it's not that complicated but it has its tricky points)

2- functionality: 3 (its functions are correct, but once in a while there may be a glitch)

3- code: 2 (I cleaned up the code and tidied it up as best I could and even added a layout to make it more presentable)

4- storage: 1 (use file creation in conjunction with stdio, stdlib and string libraries)

5- documentation: 2 (The report may have some grammatical errors and the video has an acceptable quality)

Final grade: 9 points
