This project consists of an agenda with the following functions:

1- Add note: in this option it will ask you the date in which some event of your preference will be carried out or that you are doing of the home, etc. Here we will be able to notice that at the moment of adding the date that is preferred the program will indicate us in that time of the year you are adding this note and more important so that the change of schedule in these times is considered, later it will send you a message also that the note was created and a file .txt will be created for you.

2- Verify note: this option gives us the function to verify that there is written in the note of some date that we have added, for this it is going to ask us the date of the note that we want to verify and it will throw us later that there is written in the note.

3- Modify a note: this option helps us to write in the note that was created, the program will indicate us to enter the date of the note that we want to modify, later it will ask us what we want to add as a note and it will indicate us that the note was added successfully.

4- Eliminate note: this option is useful to eliminate some note that has been added with the wrong date or some similar case, for this the program will ask you to write the date of the note that you want to eliminate later it will indicate you that the note was eliminated.

Steps to follow for the correct operation of the program:

1- First step: you will use the option "add note", follow the instructions that the program indicates together with the example in which you have to write the date in format of day, month and year finally you will press enter.

2- Second step: you will choose the option "modify a note", so you can add what you will do that day, either a birthday or even a list of things to do as mentioned above.

3- Third step: you will choose the option of "exit", this so that the changes in the notes that you have created and modified are saved and finish their process, later you will verify the folder in which you have the program to check that your .txt files are there with their name and when you open them the note that you wrote in them with the option of "modify a note" will appear correctly.

Optional steps:

If you want to verify using the program after you have first performed the above steps, you will select the "verify note" option in which you will see what is written in the .txt file you have selected to verify.

And finally, emphasizing that the above steps are performed first, you can finally delete a note that you have added in error with the "delete note" option.
